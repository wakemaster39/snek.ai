Hello All,

This file is going to server as our mechanism to let you know about changes we have made so you can track the project of snek.ai.
We will do our best to add some details about why we changed it, and also let you know about brain resets but this isn't meant to be 
a full breakdown of our code. 

We are happy to answer any questions in chat and take suggestions about what to try next though.

 * No updates will be given before this date, too numerous to count
 * Model was updated, we attempted a couple iterations of changing the controls to mouse movements. This is working but the model
 is a little odd. It appears to have resulted in a lot of random movements and no exactly the intended result we were looking for.
 * Multiprocessing agent rewrite was implemented. We made snek.ai able to have multiple friends running simultaneously. There is still
 alot of testing to be done surrounding the agent structure but it looks promising and hopefully more entertaining.
 * Rescaled rewards based on new controls
 * Brain wipe
